# EHR - Electronic Health Record System

🚀 **Exciting Announcement: Introducing My New EHR System with Enhanced User Services!** 🚀

I’m thrilled to share my **new project**, an **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system I developed, designed to streamline hospital workflows and enhance patient care. Built using **Angular**, **Java**, and a **Microservices Architecture**, this system integrates functionalities across various departments seamlessly.

## Key Features

### 🏥 **Admin / Hospital Staff Workflow:**
- Manages **doctor** and **admin** profiles. 👨‍⚕️
- Admins can **add**, **update**, or **remove** doctors, admins, and patients from the system. 🛠️
- Hospital staff/admins can **register patients**, browse **available doctors**, and **schedule appointments**. 📅
- On patient check-in, doctors instantly gain access to **medical records**, including **prescriptions**, **diagnoses**, and **family history**. 📋

### 🩺 **Doctor's Workflow:**
- Doctors can **view appointments**. On patient visit, they can view patient records, family histories, prescriptions, diagnosis, and visit info. 👩‍🔬
- During the **examination**, doctors can add new entries or draw conclusions from the patient’s current and previous states. 📄
- After completing an appointment, doctors write all examinations under the **visit info tab** for future reference by other doctors. 🔎
- Doctors can **update personal details** and **set their availability**, specifying the days and times they want to work. ⏰

### 💻 **Technologies Used:**
- **Angular** for the front end. 🌐
- **Java & Spring Boot** for backend services. 🔧
- **Microservices Architecture** with **Service Registry** and **Application Gateway**. 🏗️
- **Kafka** for real-time notifications. 🔔
- **Docker** for containerization and easy deployment. 📦
- **User Authentication & OTP Service** to manage **secure login** and **password recovery**. 🔒

This enhanced **User Services** module ensures **personalized, secure access** for each user, with robust **authentication**, **OTP-based password recovery**, and detailed **activity tracking**. With this system, **doctor-patient interaction** and **hospital operations** are streamlined for more efficient and accurate patient care. 👏

Tracks **user activities**, **login details**, and **roles**. Each user (admin, doctor, patient) has customized access with detailed logs of their activities and role-based permissions. 📝
